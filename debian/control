Description: A set of enhancements to Twisted Words' Jabber/XMPP
 It serves as a testing ground for new features and enhancements which will
 eventually end up in Twisted Words.  It currently provides sub-protocols,
 XMPP client and component support leveraging sub-protocols, and
 sub-protocol implementations for generic stanza handling, rosters, 
 service discovery, publish-subscribe, and software version.
